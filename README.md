A 32*32 SRAM Cell has been designed in TSMC 28nm technology. A 6T SRAM Cell has been designed providing appropriate sizes to the transistors and its Read and Write Static Noise Margins have been characterized using butterfly plots. Logic gates required for other designs like decoder and adder like NOR, NOT, NAND, OR, AND, XOR have been designed. Additionally, precharge and output  buffer circuits have been designed. The decoder design has been broken down into smaller decoder in order to minimize effort.
